        <h2>Article Content</h2>

        <p>Networking is one of the most effective ways to grow your business and open doors to new opportunities. However, successful networking is not just about exchanging business cards; it's about building meaningful relationships. Start by attending events that align with your industry, where you'll meet like-minded individuals who share similar goals and interests. When networking, be genuine and focus on offering value rather than immediately trying to sell yourself. Always listen actively and ask thoughtful questions, showing a sincere interest in others' work. Be strategic about following up after an event—send a personalized message to solidify the connection. Lastly, leverage social media platforms like LinkedIn to keep in touch and maintain professional relationships. By being proactive, authentic, and patient, networking can become a powerful tool in growing your business.</p>
